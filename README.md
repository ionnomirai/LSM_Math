# LSM_Math
**LSM_Math** - is my project that I developed as part of my coursework for the 'Numerical Methods' discipline during my second year at university.

## Project description
**LSM_Math** - is a program developed in C# using Windows Forms for Windows OS, designed to analyze user-entered data (a dataset of point positions in an XY coordinate system), find the optimal mathematical model, and calculate the associated function and deviation. The program implements and utilizes the least squares method algorithm to determine this model.

This application also allows for visualizing the results and visually assessing the outcomes. It is also possible to display only specific models on the graph or completely disable the visualization. In this case, the solution will be limited to a textual, mathematical result: the optimal mathematical model + the function used + the deviation.

Additionally, the program offers the ability to automatically determine the function for constructing the optimal mathematical model. Additionally, the user still has the option to manually build the model using a desired function; however, the model may not necessarily be optimal in this case.

## Application features
* selection of the number of data points for input (from 2 to 10 points);
* checking the correctness of data entry;
* selection of the function for constructing the optimal mathematical model from the following options: linear, quadratic, or exponential function;
* choose the automatic method for determining the correct function;
* the ability to display the graph of the mathematical model (both optimal and others, if necessary);
* the ability to obtain the result in a textual, mathematical form without graphical display.
